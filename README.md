## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Discord Bot (With multiple features):
  - Displaying live prices of any cryptocurrency automatically (like a twitter bot, but for discord)
  - Displaying live tweets too? 
  - Music bot? (Though complicated logistics?/TOS)
  - Maybe some fun commands?

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Timothy Khumpan

Are you able to provide with additional references from previously made Discord Bots?
Additional thoughts and ideas?
