# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Discord Bot (With multiple features):
  - Displaying live prices of any cryptocurrency automatically (like a twitter bot, but for discord)
  - Displaying live tweets too? 
  - Music bot? (Though complicated logistics?/TOS)
  - Maybe some fun commands?

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Timothy Khumpan

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Are you able to provide with additional references from previously made Discord Bots?
Additional thoughts and ideas?

# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Crypto-Pricebot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Multi-purpose bot. Announce tweets and updated crypto-prices while functioning as a music bot in command.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We want to make an automatic bot that saves us time from constantly checking upon it ourselves. Whether its viewing tweets, updated currency prices or blasting music, we want a continuous update on our interests. Perhaps we could expand on our features, such as adding on a display which shows the market cap of any coin. We would have to research how to create discord bots and allowing it to get data online and presenting it to discord.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Timothy Khumpan, Python Section 003 TA: (Joanne Nichols)

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

One good outcome would be to get at least one of our planned features done. At minimum we want a bot that can show at least the price of the crypto of that day.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome is having all of our features met reasonably. With a bot that routinely posts the updated prices of crypto if not live.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome is having all of our features working perfectly. Having a bot that updates the price in live time. Can also have more features to add on like the current market cap.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Definitely have to research how to create discord bots and how to get the data from a website and be able to display that on discord. We could split up the work and have one researching discord bots and how to have them update their data while the other researches how to get data from a website and be able to use it.
